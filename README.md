# Personal Website

Hello there!

This is my first go at creating a basic react website.  Just learning some basic react, without having to worry about the back-end work.

# Getting Started
* `npm install`
* `npm start` to start dev server
* `npm run predeploy` to get ready for production
* `npm run deploy` to deploy using gh-pages

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
